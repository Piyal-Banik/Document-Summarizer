In 1933, Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team and Scuderia\\nFerrari took over as its works team:[1] the Scuderia received Alfa&#39;s Grand Prix\\ncars of the latest specifications and fielded many famous drivers such as Tazio\\nNuvolari and Achille Varzi. In 1938, Alfa Romeo brought its racing operation again\\nin-house, forming Alfa Corse in Milan and hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new\\nracing department; therefore the Scuderia Ferrari was disbanded.[1]\\nThe first vehicle made with the Ferrari name was the 125 S. Only two of this small\\ntwo-seat sports/racing V12 car were made. In 1949, the 166 Inter was introduced\\nmarking the company&#39;s significant move into the grand touring road car market.

The Dino was produced\\nprimarily with a V6 engine, however, a V8 model was also developed. This rear mid-\\nengine layout would go on to be used in many Ferraris of the 1980s, 1990s and to\\nthe present day. Current road cars typically use V8 or V12 engines, with V8 models\\nmaking up well over half of the marque&#39;s total production.
